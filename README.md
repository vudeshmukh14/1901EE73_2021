## Project List

1. proj1/Marksheet Generator :- During the Covid19 pandemic, My professor started conducting quizzes online with the help of google forms. But there was a problem, there was no option to keep negative marking for incorrect answers, questions could only carry positive marks. So I created this module which takes the responses from google forms, grades them incorporating negative marking scheme and generates marksheets for all roll numbers. I of course added some more features like generating a concise marksheet, sending out e-mails etc.

2. proj2/Transcript Generator :- During the Covid19 pandemic, My college started giving out soft copies of transcripts. So I created a student transcipt generator for IIT Patna which on demand can incorporate new branches and courses. I of course added some more features like generating transcipts for all roll numbers, for a range of roll numbers, to add seal and sign to the transcipts etc.
